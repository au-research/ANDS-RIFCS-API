    <h2>RIF-CS Java API 2.0.0</h2>

    <p>The RIF-CS API is an API developed by the Australian National
    Data Service (ANDS) to aid developers in the processing and
    assembly of RIF-CS Documents. It is currently in the early stages
    of development and enables developers to access the structures of
    an existing RIF-CS document for simpler processing. The model
    supported is a RIF-CS DOM and most RIF-CS elements are provided
    their own classes which essentially encapsulate commonly used w3c
    DOM API methods to provide convenience classes and methods for
    obtaining element content and attributes. This enables developers
    to think about a RIF-CS Document as a collection of objects rather
    than having to carry out repetitive XML API calls in a RIF-CS
    document context.</p>

    <p>It is intended for this API to grow as further RIF-CS
    development is undertaken at The Australian National University
    (ANU).</p>

    <p>Refer to
    the <a href="http://ands.org.au/resource/techdocs.html#rifcs">RIF-CS
    documentation</a> for schema, guidelines and vocabularies which
    must be used in conjunction with this API.</p>

    <h5>Change History</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Work in progress for release 2.0.0</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated for RIF-CS v1.5. (There was not a separate release
        of this API to support RIF-CS 1.4.)</li>
        <li>The source code has been extensively reformatted. See the
        checks directory for configuration files to use with
        Checkstyle, PMD, and FindBugs. (The code passes the Checkstyle
        checks, but not all the PMD or FindBugs checks.)</li>
        <li>Existing classes in org.ands.rifcs.example have been
        renamed. For example, SampleRIFCSBuildActivity became
        SampleRIFCSBuildActivityV1Dot3Number1 to indicate that it is a
        test of RIF-CS v1.3.</li>
        <li>Incompatible changes:
	  <ul>
	    <li>The classes Right and ExistenceDate have been renamed
	    as Rights and ExistenceDates, so that they now match the
	    corresponding RIF-CS element names. The methods
	    newRight() and addRight() have been renamed to
	    newRights() and addRights().</li>
	    <li>The Collection class now supports existenceDates
	    element. </li>
	    <li>The class TemporalCoverageDate has been renamed as
	    DateWithTypeDataFormat. It is now also used in the
	    contruction of Dates objects.</li>
	    <li>The previously deprecated method
	    Collection.addRelatedInfo(String) has now been removed.</li>
	    <li></li>
	  </ul>
        <li>Defects fixed:
	  <ul>
	    <li>The Collection class did not support existenceDates
	    elements. It now does.</li>
	    <li>The rights and existenceDates elements were not
	    parsed when reading existing RIF-CS data. They now are.</li>
	    <li>Parsing of RIF-CS documents created by this API (e.g.,
	    running SampleRIFCSRead on the output of
	    SampleRIFCSBuildCollectionV1Dot3Number1) often
	    failed. This has now been fixed.</li>
	    <li>Parsing existing RIF-CS documents and then writing
	    them out added duplicate namespace declarations. This has
	    been fixed.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <li>1.3.0</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated for RIF-CS 1.3.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>1.2.0</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Added methods to support reading of existing RIF-CS
        documents</li>
        <li>Minor Javadocs updates</li>
      </ul>
      <li>1.1.0</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug preventing creation of party and service</li>
        <li>Workaround for Xerces bug where schema fragments in the
        same namespace cannot be used to generate a Schema object</li>
        <li>Added methods to location to support type attribute</li>
        <li>Minor changes to support Java 1.6 XML namespace
        processing</li>
        <li>Revised Javadocs and removed out of date URLs</li>
      </ul>

      <li>1.0.0</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial release</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: A release is numbered as <code>major.minor.patch</code>
    where <strong>major</strong>=API
    change; <strong>minor</strong>=bug fix or method(s) marked as
    deprecated; <strong>patch</strong>=minor code or documentation
    fixes.</p>
